# Xpand

For backend you need to create a database named "XpandDB", I used MSSQL, then run "update-database" in "Package Manager Console".
For frontend you need to install npm, with the command "npm install", then run app with "npm start" in the "Terminal".
I used Visual Studio for backend and Visual Studio Code for frontend.

I have a problem in "PlanetService", in "GetPlanetAndRobotsAsync()", i'm getting error 500... I stayed on this error for a day and I couldn't solve it.
